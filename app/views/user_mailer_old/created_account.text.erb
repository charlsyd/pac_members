Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,

This is just to let you know that we've created an account for you on the new membership section of our website. Right now it's just being used for billing info, but we're hoping to expand on that soon!

We've created a random password for you, but suggest you log in and change it ASAP. To do so, visit http://members.thepacificclub.com/login and use these credentials:

Email: <% @user.email %>
Password: <% @pwd %>

If you have any questions just let us know. Thanks!

The Pacific Club
