Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,

This is just a friendly reminder that your membership will automatically renew on <%= @user.membership_expiration.strftime("%B #{@user.membership_expiration.day.ordinalize}, %Y") %>. Don't worry - you don't need to do anything! Just sit back, relax, and keep an eye on your inbox for the receipt.

If you don't want to renew your membership just reply to this email and let us know.

Thanks!

The Pacific Club
